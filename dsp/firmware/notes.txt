######### TIMERS ##############
TIM2 is reserved for ST LLD
ADC can trigger off: TIM2, TIM3, TIM8
Encoder is hooked into TIM2 and TIM5
DAC can trigger off: TIM6 TIM8 TIM7 TIM5 TIM2 TIM4

So run encoder on TIM5
Run ADC on TIM3 (fx) and TIM8 (inst)
Run DAC off TIM8 (shared with inst ADC)

######### ADCs #############
Use ADC1 and ADC2 for inst and fx respectively

######### DACs #############
Use DAC1
